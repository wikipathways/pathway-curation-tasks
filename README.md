## Finding a curation task of interest

### By label

Curation tasks are labeled to make it easier to find a task of interest to you:

- By topic area: for example **drug mechanism pathway**, **disease genes**
- By novelty in terms of gene content: for example **novel disease genes**, **novel genes**
- By Community: for example **[Lipid](https://www.wikipathways.org/communities/lipids.html)**, **[Disease](https://www.wikipathways.org/communities/diseases.html)**, **[CPTAC](https://www.wikipathways.org/communities/cptac.html)**
- By difficulty level: **good first issue** (simpler tasks designed for beginners), **needs work** (more challenging tasks related to updating existing pathways)
- By source material: **KEGG** (suggested pathways insipred by the [KEGG database](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)), **PFOCR** (suggested new pathways from published pathway figures in the [PFOCR database](https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/))

### By search

Using the search bar at the top of the [Pathway Curation Tasks](https://github.com/wikipathways/pathway-curation-tasks/issues), you can enter keywords to find relevant issues, i.e. "cancer".
